# From Docushare collection 1777, v1.0, March 2010.

The throughput curves in this directory should be considered 
'baseline' for the current behavior of LSST. These curves are 
identical to those considered in the SRD except that only y4 (as 'y') 
has been included here (for simplificiation) and an X=1.2 atmosphere
has been used to compile the 'total' throughputs. 

Note that these throughput curves are subject to change as our knowledge
of the LSST systems improve and prototypes become available. 


m1.dat, m2.dat, m3.dat represent the current mirror throughputs used in the SRD.
lens1.dat, lens2.dat, lens3.dat represent the current lens throughputs ""
detector.dat is the current detector sensitivity in the SRD.

filter_u / g / r / i / z / y. dat represent the current filter (filter only!) 
  throughput curves used in the SRD. Note that y = y4 is the current baseline filter. 


atmos_std.dat is the atmosphere throughput likely at LSST at 1.2 airmasses. 

total_*.dat throughput curves represent the combination of all components in the LSST 
  system - mirrors, lenses, filter, detector, and the zenith atmos_std.dat atmosphere. 

All curves are in nanometers, with throughput represented by a number between 0 and 1. 


NOTES:
---------

The simulation of the instrument gives 5 sigma PS
magnitudes which are slightly brighter (i.e. conservative) as compared
to line 11 of document-8857 (aka SNRv1.2.pdf). Note that these 
magnitudes are for observations at zenith in dark sky. 
The sensitivities in table 2 0805.2366v2 seem of w.r.t the one in 
document-8857.
